Banking
=======

The basic goal of the project is to build a banking application which allows a user to create an account and perform
basic operations like view balance, withdraw, deposit and transfer amounts to other users. Two levels of concurrency
are involved – (i) serving multiple clients tp log into the banking server and (ii) allowing multiple transactions
to be done on the same account at same time by multiple users.
